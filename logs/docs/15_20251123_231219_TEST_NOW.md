# 🧪 Run Smiley Test NOW

## Copy-Paste Commands

```bash
# Close KiCad
killall kicad

# Enable test mode and launch
export KIDOOM_TEST_MODE=true
open -a KiCad
```

## In KiCad

1. Open any PCB file (or File → New → Blank PCB)
2. **Tools → External Plugins → "KiDoom - DOOM on PCB"**
3. Should see rotating smiley face made of PCB traces

## Expected Results

### ✅ SUCCESS
- Smiley face appears and rotates smoothly
- Console shows frame updates every second
- No crashes, stable for 60+ seconds
- **Conclusion**: Timer architecture works! Problem is in DOOM's threading/queue

### ❌ FAILURE (Crash)
- KiCad crashes when you click the plugin
- Or crashes during animation
- **Conclusion**: wx.Timer doesn't work in KiCad plugins on this macOS version

## What You'll See (Success)

```
======================================================================
SMILEY FACE TEST - Timer-Based Rendering
======================================================================
✓ Created 68 traces for smiley face
Starting timer...
✓ Timer started (20 FPS)
...
Frame 20, angle 100°
Frame 40, angle 200°
...
```

## To Stop Test

Click OK on the dialog window

## To Run DOOM Again

```bash
# In a NEW terminal (or unset the variable):
unset KIDOOM_TEST_MODE
open -a KiCad
# Then run plugin normally
```

## Troubleshooting

**No smiley visible**: Zoom out (View → Zoom to Fit)

**Plugin still runs DOOM**: Environment variable didn't work. Try this in KiCad Python console:
```python
import os
os.environ['KIDOOM_TEST_MODE'] = 'true'
```
Then run the plugin.
