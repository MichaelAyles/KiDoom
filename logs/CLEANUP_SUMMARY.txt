KiDoom Repository Cleanup - Summary
===================================

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Organization (logs/docs/)
- Moved 18 markdown documents to logs/docs/
- Added chronological prefixes (01-18) with timestamps
- Created logs/docs/README.md explaining the timeline
- Archived original README.md as 00_original_README.md

### 2. Source Code Organization
- Created src/ directory for Python source
- Moved standalone_renderer.py to src/
- Created proper entry points:
  - run_doom.sh (DOOM launcher with modes)
  - run_standalone_renderer.py (renderer launcher)

### 3. Scripts Organization
- Created scripts/ directory
- Moved test_standalone.sh to scripts/
- Moved deprecated files to scripts/deprecated_*

### 4. Root Directory Cleanup
- Only entry points and key docs in root
- Removed clutter
- Clear purpose for each file

### 5. Documentation Updates
- New README.md (concise, modern)
- STATUS.md (current project state)
- logs/docs/README.md (development timeline)

## Final Structure

Root Level (Clean):
- README.md          # Main documentation
- CLAUDE.md          # Claude Code instructions  
- STATUS.md          # Project status
- LICENSE            # License file
- run_doom.sh        # DOOM launcher
- run_standalone_renderer.py  # Renderer launcher

Directories:
- src/               # Python source code
- kicad_doom_plugin/ # KiCad plugin
- doom/              # DOOM engine and binaries
- tests/             # Test scripts
- scripts/           # Utility scripts
- logs/docs/         # Development documentation (18 files)
- bin/               # (Reserved for future binaries)

## Documentation Timeline (logs/docs/)

The 18 files tell the story:
01-04: Initial implementation
05-11: macOS threading challenges and fixes
12-15: Smiley face isolation testing
16-18: Standalone renderer development

Each file is prefixed with:
- Sequential number (01-18)
- Timestamp (YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
- Original filename

Example: 11_20251123_230231_FINAL_FIX_V3.md

## What Was Preserved

ALL documentation was preserved! Nothing was deleted.
Everything is in logs/docs/ with full chronology intact.
