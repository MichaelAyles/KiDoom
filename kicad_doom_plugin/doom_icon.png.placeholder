This is a placeholder for the DOOM icon.

Create a 24x24 or 32x32 PNG icon and save it as:
  kicad_doom_plugin/doom_icon.png

The icon will appear in KiCad's toolbar when the plugin is loaded.

Suggested icon content:
- DOOM logo
- PCB trace pattern
- Combination of both

The plugin will work without an icon, but the toolbar button will be blank.
